I am a passionate code writer for open source software, i.e. development of web applications.

Currently, I am lead software developer of NEST Desktop, an educational application for NEST Simulation Tool.

Furthermore I like to analyze and visualize data from various numerical simulations of the brain activities.


#### Academic background

In 2021 I finished my PhD in computational neuroscience at University of Freiburg and the research questions were:
- What role do the network connectivity and network dynamics play in the transfer of information from one network to another?
- How neurons interact with network structure to shape the network activity dynamics?
- How the activity dynamics of the network and information transfer can be controlled by external stimulation?
